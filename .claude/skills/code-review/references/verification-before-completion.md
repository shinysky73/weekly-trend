# Verification Before Completion

## Overview

Claiming work is complete without verification is dishonesty, not efficiency.

**Core principle:** Evidence before claims, always.

**Violating the letter of this rule is violating the spirit of this rule.**

## The Iron Law

NO COMPLETION CLAIMS WITHOUT FRESH VERIFICATION EVIDENCE

If you haven't run the verification command in this message, you cannot claim it passes.

## The Gate Function

BEFORE claiming any status or expressing satisfaction:
1. IDENTIFY: What command proves this claim?
2. RUN: Execute the FULL command (fresh, complete)
3. READ: Full output, check exit code, count failures
4. VERIFY: Does output confirm the claim?
   - If NO: State actual status with evidence
   - If YES: State claim WITH evidence
5. ONLY THEN: Make the claim

Skip any step = lying, not verifying

## Common Failures (claim → requires → not sufficient)

- Tests pass → Test command output: 0 failures → Previous run, "should pass"
- Linter clean → Linter output: 0 errors → Partial check, extrapolation
- Build succeeds → Build command: exit 0 → Linter passing, logs look good
- Bug fixed → Test original symptom: passes → Code changed, assumed fixed
- Regression test works → Red-green cycle verified → Test passes once
- Agent completed → VCS diff shows changes → Agent reports "success"
- Requirements met → Line-by-line checklist → Tests passing

## Project Verification Commands

```bash
# Run ALL tests (required before any "tests pass" claim)
pnpm test

# Backend only
pnpm -F @milo-seah/api-server test

# Frontend only
pnpm -F @milo-seah/user-client test

# Build verification (required before any "build succeeds" claim)
pnpm build

# Lint check
pnpm lint
```

## Red Flags - STOP

- Using "should", "probably", "seems to"
- Expressing satisfaction before verification ("Great!", "Perfect!", "Done!", etc.)
- About to commit/push/PR without verification
- Trusting agent success reports
- Relying on partial verification
- Thinking "just this once"
- Tired and wanting work over
- ANY wording implying success without having run verification

## Rationalization Prevention

- "Should work now" → RUN the verification
- "I'm confident" → Confidence != evidence
- "Just this once" → No exceptions
- "Linter passed" → Linter != compiler
- "Agent said success" → Verify independently
- "I'm tired" → Exhaustion != excuse
- "Partial check is enough" → Partial proves nothing
- "Different words so rule doesn't apply" → Spirit over letter

## Key Patterns

**Tests:**
```
[Run: pnpm test] [See: 888 tests passing, 0 failures] → "All tests pass"
NOT: "Should pass now" / "Looks correct"
```

**Regression tests (TDD Red-Green):**
```
Write test → Run (pass) → Revert fix → Run (MUST FAIL) → Restore → Run (pass)
NOT: "I've written a regression test" (without red-green verification)
```

**Build:**
```
[Run: pnpm build] [See: exit 0, no errors] → "Build passes"
NOT: "Linter passed" (linter doesn't check compilation)
```

**Requirements:**
```
Re-read plan → Create checklist → Verify each → Report gaps or completion
NOT: "Tests pass, phase complete"
```

**Agent delegation:**
```
Agent reports success → Check VCS diff → Verify changes → Report actual state
NOT: Trust agent report
```

## Integration with TDD Workflow

Before `/commit-tdd [BEHAVIORAL]`:
- Run `pnpm test` → See "X passing, 0 failing"
- Run `pnpm build` → See exit 0
- THEN commit

Before `/commit-tdd [STRUCTURAL]`:
- Same as above PLUS verify no behavioral changes (same test count before/after)

## The Bottom Line

No shortcuts for verification.
Run the command. Read the output. THEN claim the result.
This is non-negotiable.
